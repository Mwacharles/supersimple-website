<h1 id="title">INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL OF MUSIC</h1>
<h5 id="subtitle">By Charles, Founder & Buster Moon</h5>
    <div class="content">
        <p id="p1">My name is Charles Mwangi.<br> CEO of Electron E Company.<br> I love music, but I can’t sing.<br> So, I built a school.<br> A place for talent to shine.<br> A stage for creativity.</p>

        <p id="p2">Music has existed for centuries.<br> It began with nature’s rhythm.<br> The hum of the wind.<br> The beat of the drums.<br> The songs of early civilizations.<br> A language beyond words.</p>

        <p id="p3">Ancient cultures embraced sound.<br> From Egyptian melodies.<br> To Greek symphonies.<br> Music was more than entertainment.<br> It was spiritual, emotional, cultural.<br> A force that shaped history.</p>

        <p id="p4">Over time, music evolved.<br> The Renaissance brought harmonies.<br> Classical composers shaped the future.<br> Then jazz, rock, pop, and hip-hop emerged.<br> Every era brought new legends.<br> Every sound told a new story.</p>

        <p id="p5">Music is beauty in motion.<br> A simple note can spark emotions.<br> A melody can heal the soul.<br> From love songs to battle anthems.<br> It moves people in ways words cannot.</p>

        <p id="p6">Stars are born from passion.<br> Unknown voices become legends.<br> Hard work turns dreams into reality.<br> Every star starts small.<br> But their fire, talent, and persistence make them great.</p>

        <p id="p7">This school is a gateway.<br> A chance for hidden stars to rise.<br> To be heard, seen, and admired.<br> To transform talent into greatness.<br> To prove that dreams are worth chasing.</p>

        <p id="p8">Every weekend, a grand show.<br> Artists will earn from tickets.<br> A VIP section will hold celebrity guests.<br> The world will witness greatness.<br> Right here, on this stage.</p>

        <p id="p9">29th May 2025, the grand opening.<br> Everyone is invited.<br> A night of music and dreams.<br> A new era begins.<br> Join us. Celebrate with us.</p>

        <p id="p10">The story of music continues.<br> New stars will rise.<br> And their voices will change the world.</p>
